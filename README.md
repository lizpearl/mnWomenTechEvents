mnWomenTechEvents
=================
The goal of this project is to have a Minneapolis women in technology calendar that displays both Meetup and Eventbrite events.  Groups displayed include women in technology groups well as other popular technology groups.  This calendar can be used either for scheduling of women in technology events or to see what events are happening in the area.
